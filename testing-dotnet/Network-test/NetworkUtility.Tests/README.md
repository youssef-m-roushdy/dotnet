 When you mock DNS.SendDNS() using a mocking framework (like FakeItEasy), the real method is not called. Instead, the mocked version is used, which doesn't have any actual logic unless you specify its behavior.

So, when you write:

csharp
Copy code
A.CallTo(() => _dNS.SendDNS()).Returns(true);
You're explicitly telling the mock to return true when SendDNS() is called during the test.

If you don't configure the mock, it won't know how to behave, and by default, it might return false or another default value (like null for reference types, or false for booleans). This is why your test would fail without that line, because SendDNS() would return false when mocked by default, even if the real method would have returned true.

In summary:

Without mocking: The real method would return true, but when you replace it with a mock, it needs specific instructions on how to behave.
With mocking: A.CallTo(() => _dNS.SendDNS()).Returns(true); ensures that the mock will return true, simulating the expected behavior of the real SendDNS() method during the test.
This way, you can isolate your test to focus purely on the logic of NetworkService without relying on the actual implementation of DNS.
